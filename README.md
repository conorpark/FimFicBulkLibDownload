# FimFicBulkLibDownload
This Chrome Extension allows users to Bulk Download/Export stories in their Fimfiction.net bookshelf. If you have hundreds or possibly thousands of stories, clicking "download" for each one seems like an impossible task, for which this extension addresses.
Currently, three file types are supported, TXT, HTML, and unformatted EPUB. 

Planned Features:
- Multithread/tab download to increase download speed by ~4x
- Expanded file type capability
- Progress bar/specific story download failure message **(60% complete)**
- Fix occasional file download error where a story is downloaded successfully, but the file itself is missing it's format **(100% complete)**
- Add author to title of downloaded file **(100% complete)**

Upcoming Projects:
- Spotify Playlist music downloader, with auto search capability between three sources, Youtube, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp.
- Bandcamp downloader
